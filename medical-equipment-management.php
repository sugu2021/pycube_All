                      <p>  Broadly, equipment management in medicine can be subdivided into the following categories:
1.	Inspection and Preventive Maintenance 
2.	Corrective Maintenance 

                          The Inspection subcategory is responsible for investigating the real-time translation of the quoted or technical purpose of given equipment. In simpler words, one can test the medical equipment through inspection to understand the extent of realization of the listed functions of a device. The preventive maintenance subcategory involves ensuring that the device can operate under strenuous conditions, without immediate faltering or failure. </p>
