                            <p> Medical equipment is an essential enterprise-critical component of a healthcare system, for both 
								hospitals in general and hospital EDs. Studies conducted by [Source] with data collected from 
								several healthcare centers indicate each hospital has about 15-20 pieces of medical equipment for 
								each staffed hospital bed, that amounts to a capital investment of about US$200,000–
								400,000/staffed bed. This suggests that a 500-bed hospital acquires more than US$100–200 
								million worth of medical equipment, and even more if it is affiliated with a medical school. 
								According to the same studies, annual medical equipment maintenance and management cost 
								amounts to approximately 1% of the total hospital budget, which translates to $5 million/year for 
								a 500-bed hospital.
