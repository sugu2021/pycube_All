                                         <p>  Healthcare organizations maintain and manage a large volume of high-value assets. Hence, healthcare asset preventive maintenance programs are vital and can reduce the frequency of unanticipated breakdowns by identifying potential equipment issues before they cause delays. Additionally, a healthcare asset preventive maintenance program typically extends the useful lifespan of an asset by keeping assets in optimal conditions. 

Healthcare asset management leverages technology to monitor the movement of equipment and prevent asset loss. To prevent the loss of medical equipment, assets are tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags which then automatically identifies and tracks the tags attached to the equipment. These tags are cost-effective and deliver high value for the money spent.
