                            <h2>CAPITAL PLANNING USING END OF LIFE </h2>
                            <p> Hospitals spend annually significant amount of time on budgetary planning to decide what new assets to purchase. These decisions are usually made either by asking the care delivery personnel what equipment they need, or the biomedical teams make the decisions through experience. These teams usually make purchase requests based on their experience locating and finding medical equipment and tend to add at least 20% more as buffer to such purchase requests. These decisions are not based on information available on actual equipment use or the assets nearing their end of life that need to be replaced. These decisions are more accurate when based on actual utilization information and end of life standards established by the American Hospital Association or similar organizations.</p>

                            <p> Hospitals usually have a significant number of equipment that are either nearing end of life or past their end of life. There is also equipment that have significant maintenance issues when under warranty leaving hospitals with equipment maintenance challenges after end of warranty. Additionally, equipment from name brand manufactures purchased by hospitals expecting this equipment to provide the best service during their lifetime might have faced product alerts or product recalls from the manufacturer. All these might force the hospitals, especially during annual budgetary and procurement cycles to make decisions on whether to continue repairing and maintaining such equipment or replace this high maintenance equipment.</p>

                            <p> Addressing the Joint Commission’s goal to provide a safe, functional and supportive environment as part of the Environment of Care (EC) is an important requirement for all accredited organizations including Hospitals. Compliance with this process requires hospitals to maintain documentation that proper compliance and inspection checks have been done on all assets that are essential and required in care delivery. Hospitals usually perform these checks using a paper based manual process that leads to unreliable compliance and inspections checks and sometimes inaccurate information on the asset’s conditions. By using technology hospitals can bring transparency, reliability and accountability to this process and ensure no such assets are in a noncompliant state.</p>
