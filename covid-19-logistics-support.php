We provide safe and secure storage for critical COVID-19 Supplies in our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic medical equipment storage facilities.</h3>
                            <p> The global impact of COVID-19 novel coronavirus is rightfully causing many hospitals to discuss and re-evaluate how hospitals respond and deal with this crisis.
