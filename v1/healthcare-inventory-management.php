                                <p>Healthcare inventory management is crucial for ensuring consistent patient outcomes but keeping track of the equipment and medical supplies can be strenuous. Most hospital administrators struggle to manage their inventory and often incorrectly order the amount of supplies their facility needs. They often order in excess and, after a few months, discover that some unused supplies are about to expire.

                                <p>At hospitals, it is difficult to know the right amount to order, as the demand for equipment and medical supplies fluctuates on a daily basis. The incoming patients determine the requirement, but the staff cannot wait for them to arrive first and then order the supplies. A second's delay can worsen a patient's condition. Proper healthcare inventory management is essential to keep a count of the supplies and equipment, and correctly estimate the quantity needed at a specific time.
