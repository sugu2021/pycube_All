                                <h2>Patient Safety</h2>
                                <p>Patient safety is a major concern for healthcare facilities the world over. Although patient tracking addresses this to an extent, other factors like healthcare assets and utilities still have a bearing on patient safety. Integrated <a href="https://www.pycube.com/">enterprise asset management systems</a> for hospitals help simplify safety processes so that facilities can easily comply with safety regulations. Patient safety starts with patient tracking solutions which rely on active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Real-Time Location Services (RTLS).

                                <p>Better quality care and a feeling of well-being for patients can be achieved with superior security in a hospital’s operations. <a href="https://www.pycube.com/">Enterprise asset management</a> at hospitals can help healthcare administrators keep better tabs on patients and medical assets. When all aspects of patient care are integrated into a central database, there is less margin for errors and more opportunities to serve them better.

                                    Patient safety is a prime concern for hospitals and it needs meticulous planning and preparation. Pycube’s Enterprise asset management system for hospitals features inbuilt programs to deal with infection control and sanitization, to promote patient well-being and safety. Breaches of safety protocols should be minimized to enhance a patient’s trust with a facility.

                            <p>

                                Hospitals should gain visibility and ultimately reduce response times when safety concerns arise. This can be achieved by creating real-time alerts for when these safety concerns - such as, patients or personnel falling, patients, visitors, or assets moving where they don’t belong, etc. Medical staff would then follow well-planned protocols when such instances occur. This can help prevent patient dissatisfaction with the medical facility. </p>

                            <p>With today’s technology, it is easier to maintain patient safety and security while still preserving patients independence.
