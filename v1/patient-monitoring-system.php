                                                       <p>The need for a Patient Monitoring System can be considered as old as the establishment of healthcare facilities themselves. Doctors, nurses and healthcare providers for long have faced the challenges of monitoring patients admitted under their care. In several critical cases of surgical intervention or irreparable damage, monitoring the patient for maintaining a stable medical state becomes beyond vital. The Patient Monitoring and Management System is the answer to all such challenges. The fluidity and furtherance brought by a <a herf="https://www.pycube.com/">Patient Management System</a> is remarkably assisting. </p>

                        <h2>Patient Management Software</h2>
                        <p>The key feature in a Patient Management Software worth noting is its versatility. If the current staff and personnel at a hospital or healthcare facility could manage and monitor n patients simultaneously, the involvement of a Patient Monitoring system could easily increase this, by say, 4 to 5n. The substantial increase in the capacity of patients, while an attractive feature, isn’t everything that a Patient Management system has to offer. A host of ways and features can be included in the system to achieve ultimate integration and consequently a much higher degree of caregiving for the administered patients.

                                           <p> Some of the exclusive features one can enjoy by virtue of Pycube’s Patient Management software involve:</p>

                                           <ul><li>Highly facilitated patient entry and admittance - Entering and initial processing of patients is very streamlined using Pycube’s Patient Management system. This is especially helpful in the case of newly admitted and inpatient cases. </li>
                                               <li>Assisted care for demanding patients - Certain healthcare facilities encounter patients that are more at-risk for accidentally walking off the premise, or falling and injuring themselves. This is especially true in the case of senior-living assistant homes or for patients who suffer with Alzheimer’s.. The Patient Monitoring system is even more applicable in such facilities than a general hospital.</li></ul>
