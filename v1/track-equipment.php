                                <p>To track equipment in an increasingly high-quality patient care demand is proving difficult for healthcare facilities. As well, these hospitals are facing increasing pressure to ensure these assets are properly utilized. </p>

                                <p>Improper asset tracking leads to poor asset utilization and increased asset operational failures, causing substantial losses as well as ineffectiveness due to tracking equipment that is outdated. Pycube’s <a href="https://www.pycube.com/">asset tracking solutions</a> specialize in not only tracking assets, but also improving utilization and decreasing incidents of compliance failures.

                               <br>
                                <b> Patient and Personnel Tracking</b>
                                        <p>Enhance the efficiency of patient care through more effective time management. Critical data, sent via mobile devices worn by the patients, are available on stationary computers, as well as on table allowing a quicker response time to any risk which improves the quality of healthcare services. Implementing RFID in healthcare institutions, allows for a typical paper trail or a record to make any corrections in the case of an audit.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            With RFID in healthcare institutions, medical assets that might often find themselves lost or misplaced are traced and tracked. To track equipment, <a href="https://www.pycube.com/rfid-tag.php">RFID tracking tags</a> placed on the assets provide real-time solutions to items being walked off the hospital property and tracks assets as they move throughout the facility. Furthermore, tagging and tracking allows for status updates on the inventory.

                                    <b>Monitor Inventory</b>
                                    <p>Several medications require proper temperature control. Storage shelves and rooms should be monitored continuously to ensure damage is avoided to the assets. Pycube’s Environmental Monitoring tracking solution can alert the appropriate staff in case of any changes in the room temperature.</p>
                                    <p>As the healthcare sector evolves, its use of modern technology provides quality healthcare. RFID in healthcare helps focus on patients, reduces downtimes, decreases spending on medical assets, tracks equipment and facilitates patient safety.</p>
