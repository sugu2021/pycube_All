                            <p> Patients rely on hospitals to respond to their illnesses swiftly and promptly. In order to keep this trust, hospitals have to rely on both their staff and assets. Hospitals, however, can face difficulty trusting their assets as they are sometimes misplaced or stolen. This causes their staff to spend precious time looking for assets that may have already left their facilities, putting the staff behind schedule and making patients wait during time imperative moments. </p>

patients will often walk away, without notice, and find themselves in dangerous situations.  </p>

                            <p> Predictive maintenance is a surefire way to drastically enhance asset efficiency. The aim of
predictive maintenance is to predict when a particular piece of medical equipment might fail and
schedule maintenance accordingly. This involves the testing and constant monitoring of machines
to predict equipment failures.  </p>
