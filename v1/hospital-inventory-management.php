                        <p>Some of the challenges faced by hospitals are a shortage of stock, overstocking, sorting the stock order, stock tracking, etc. Hospital inventory management is quite complicated and investing in advanced software helps you track your assets, which is a crucial step in managing your inventory. It also oversees real-time inventory data, monitors trends, and orders before supplies fall below critical levels with the help of barcode systems and RFID technology. It is the focal point of any hospitalâ€™s asset tracking system.
                            
                        Hospital asset management improves the inventory, ensuring all the critical supplies and assets needed are readily available. It enhances utilization rates of existing equipment, reduces the unnecessary purchase of excess inventory, and helps hospitals focus on patient care by automating hospital inventory management.
