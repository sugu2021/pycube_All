                        <p>Pycube’s aktivu™ Asset Loss Prevention solution, combined with SyncSens™ RFID and SyncSens™ tags, provide control over the assets in your hospital. Anytime a SyncSens™ tagged asset approaches a monitored choke point in your hospital, a trigger generated lets you get alerted, visually through Strobes, audibly through audible alarms, or electronically through messages delivered by the aktivu™ application to either your mobile or your desktop. These alerts remind you of this potential loss until the asset is recovered and reconciled by authorized hospital staff.

                        <p>Most hospitals based on studies conducted are found to have an average asset utilization between 35% and 40%. Pycube’s aktivu™ Asset Utilization takes your data from SyncSens™ RTLS or the hospitals installed RTLS, runs proprietary algorithms to provide you the average utilization for each asset and by each asset category. This data driven intelligence provides you information on the utilization patterns of each asset in your hospital. You can view how many days an asset was in use, how many days it was in maintenance, how many days it was in the shop for repairs or how many days it was idle and not put to active use. Combined with financial data this can you give you visibility into the forecasted potential revenue and actual revenue generated. </p>

Instead of making unsystematic, unplanned, arbitrary purchasing decisions for new capital purchases, Pycube’s aktivu™ Capital Planning solution gives you intelligent analytics and data driven capability to make capital purchasing decisions based on the number of assets actively used, the number of assets prone to high maintenance and repair, the number of asset available but not used actively and the cost of the assets.

Pycube’s aktivu™ Inspection Rounding Automation solution combined with SyncSens™ RFID lets hospitals completely digitize their compliance inspection rounding process, eliminating all paper-driven and manual processes. The solution let us you schedule inspection rounds and take prompt corrective action required for the checks to pass. For a facility with a 1000 Fire Extinguishers that need to be checked every quarter, a manual process would require approximately 4000 individual paper-based inspection checklists taking a resource approximately 2 weeks each quarter to complete. These paper-based checklists must then be collected and compiled by an administrative resource so reports can be generated for submission to the appropriate AHJ. All this time-consuming process can be eliminated and reduced to a, less than 3 day, automated process with Pycube’s aktivu™ Inspection Rounding Automation solution.</p>
